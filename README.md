## 🎯 Project Overview

**AgriCredit Score** is an innovative AI-powered platform that revolutionizes agricultural finance by providing fair, transparent, and data-driven credit assessments for farmers. Unlike traditional banking systems that rely heavily on credit history and collateral, our system evaluates farmers based on their actual farming capabilities, practices, and potential.

### 🌟 Project Vision
*"Empowering every farmer with access to fair credit opportunities based on their agricultural expertise, not just their financial history."*
